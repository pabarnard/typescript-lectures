# TypeScript lessons

This repository contains notes from TypeScript as I learn more about the language.  I believe that the best way to learn is to test and build using the knowledge acquired, and I hope to pass some of this information along to anyone who wants it.  Enjoy these lessons I've crafted, and if you have suggestions on how I can improve them, please let me know!
